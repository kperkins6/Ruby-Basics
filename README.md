##Installation:
  Installing Ruby is trivial on Ubuntu, but slightly more complicated on OSX and Windows. 
  * Ubuntu: Open up the terminal and type 'sudo apt-get install ruby-full'.
  * OSX: Ruby comes pre-installed on OSX, but it's not the most current version. You can update to the most current version using [rvm](https://rvm.io/).
  * Windows: Download the latest version of the ruby installer [here](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/).
